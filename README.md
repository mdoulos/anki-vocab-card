This anki card template creates a stylish and aesthetically pleasing way to learn vocabulary words.

The cards have rounded corners and a texture to make them appear like actual physical cards. On the front side is an image and on the back side is the target vocabulary word for the image.

This example is used for learning a foreign language.

Tapping or clicking on the target vocab word will have a native speaker pronounce the word. Clicking or tapping on the photo icon will cycle through available photos.

A masculine and feminine form for the target word is under the target word if specific.

A description of the target word in English is at the bottom.
